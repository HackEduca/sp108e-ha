# sp108e-ha
This project is here because I didn't anywhere on Internet the solution for controlling a SP108e led controller threw Home Assistant.
There is a forum where we discuss this subject :
https://community.home-assistant.io/t/sp108e-digital-wifi-light-strip-controller

My setup is:

* One RPi that runs NodeRed on which there is a flow that control the SP108e threw a Python script (included in this project)
